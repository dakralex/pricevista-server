## Requirement analysis

The project's primary objective is to establish a platform for tracking and comparing article price changes across
various supermarkets. This functionality aims to provide more transparency, allowing users to discern if multiple
supermarket chains adjust prices for their store-branded products simultaneously. This is useful for consumers, who
want to make more informed choices and for a broader audience that could use the platform to audit a fair market.
